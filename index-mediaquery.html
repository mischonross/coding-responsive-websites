  	<h2><strong>A little bit about me.</strong></h2>
   <div class="half-width">
    <p>I've made my home base in Wakanda. I am currently an empty   nester and LOVING IT! I have sons who are grown up and living all over the world. My journey into tech started in the 7th grade in a computer class. I quickly found that I loved software and figuring out how it worked.  I started with the basics (Word, Excel, Access and eventually SQL). I've always dabbled in some sort of web building. I was fascinated with DOS 3.1 and that foundation led me to want to learn a lot of other things.  I am a true believer in life-long learning.  I want to be in a position where I build a business as a freelancer and show off all the wonderful skills I learned at Skillcrush!</p>
</div>
 
 <div class="half-width">
  <p>Curiosity about software, computers &amp; the web, opened a door that could never be shut. When I learned how to build my first website, I realized I found something that gave me the freedom &amp; versatility I was looking for in my work. Now I've made a full switch to front-end development, where I can use my organization skills and eye for detail to write clean, elegant code.  I am looking forward to the day where I have a steady client base and freelancing full-time.</p>

     <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
	  <p>
	  	My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate, trouble-shoot and accessible.

     <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
	  <p>
	  	I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on. I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a habit to stay up to date on current best practices.

      <h3>Easy PSD to HTML Conversion</h3>
	  <p>
	  	You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly &amp; accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.
